# Prodwarn

In A beautiful day, you accidentally test on the production system instead of the dev/test systems when coding. This is a way that the incident is to be.

`Prodwarn` is a browser extension that will warn us when using the production system instead of the dev/test system. It is an open-source software. Therefore, you can contribute for it on Github.

**Don't test in production, please!**

Let feel free to contribute or send us your feedback!
